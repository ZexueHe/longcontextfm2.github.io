### Topics of Interest

__Centering on "instructions,"__ we encourage submissions on the following topics:

* __Modeling:__ algorithms and pipelines for learning from instructions, human feedback, and human intent; designing training objectives and rewards; training and inference efficiency
* __Data Collection:__ crowd-sourcing; synthetic data generation; data democratization
* __Empirical Analysis:__ effective and holistic evaluation; failure modes; frontier problems; interpretability
* __Engineering and Open-sourcing:__ best practice in training, evaluation and deployment; open-sourcing efforts; openness and reproducibility
* __Applications:__ long-context, multi-round and personalized instruction-following models
* __Instruction + X:__ interdisciplinary research involving instructions (X = vision, robotics, games, art, etc.)
* __Limitations, Risks and Safety:__ bias and fairness; factuality and hallucination; safety concerns arising from instruction-following models
* Other adjacent research topics (e.g., in-context learning, prompting, multi-task learning) that enable better responses to instructions in dynamic environments

<br>
